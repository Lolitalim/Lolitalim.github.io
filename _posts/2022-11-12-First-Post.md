I had blogging on several blog platforms since childhood, and always dreamed of having my own blog.
Since my old laptop was too bad, even got stuck when configuring github pages.
So this try has been delayed for five years.

Finally I start my first own blog (on github pages)today.

Later I will publish the articles I wrote before, some are published, some are unpublished, and some are unfinished drafts. 
Keep it as original as possible.
