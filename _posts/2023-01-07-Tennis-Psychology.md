### Play to your strengths:
+ Don't obsess about the weaknesses.
+ Aiming to reduce your error rate and increase your consistency. Unforced errors are what lose tennis matches. 
+ Next time you’re stuck way back on the court and your opponent is keeping you deep don’t be tempted to go for the impossible winning drive. The chances are you’ll go long or hit it into the net. Play it safe and keep the point alive. Hit it long, deep and high into your opponent’s court. This will buy you time to recover, it’ll mean you can get back onto the court and steady yourself for the next shot. The fewer errors you commit, the more games you’re going to win.
+ Imagine you’re a club player. You’ve got a powerful first serve that, when it goes in, is practically unreturnable, but your ground strokes are erratic. You’re down 30–40, so you decide to reduce the power of your serve to make sure it goes in. Don’t! Think about it logically. Your serve is your strength so go for a big one. You could even go for two big serves and forget about your second weaker serve. What’s the best chance of winning the point? In this case it’s your cannonball serve so use it. You don’t see the top players holding back when the pressure’s on. They just go for it. You should do the same.
