Gregorian chant

Dies irae is a medieval Latin  poem characterized by its accentual stress and rhymed lines. 
The metre is trochaic. 
The poem describes the Last Judgment, the trumpet summoning souls before the throne of God, where the saved will be delivered and the unsaved cast into eternal flames.
The first melody set to these words, a Gregorian chant.
